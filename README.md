# VR Story Time 2 - Melody and the Flute of Harmoneyville
'VR Story Time' is a yearly project that we took in the Hebrew University, in collaboration with students from the Bezalel Academy, Music students to produce the sound effects and background music, and Computer Science students to produce the overall scene build and program the experience.

The goal was to create an interactive story for kids, by taking a classic story, and building the enviroment, narration, and puzzles throughout the story, to engage the user in the story world, and allow him to help and experience the plot in VR.

## Goals

It's purpose wasn't only enternainment, throughout time we realized that it could also serve children who are getting treatments, either at the hospital, home, etc.

The biggest challenge was to create the experience from a stationary position, such as sitting on a chair, or in bed, without requiring to move around.

We also decided to discard the VR kit's controllers (the one you hold in your hands), and rely only on Hand Tracking technology, to create a more realistic experience, and create a more intimate experience with the story and the world itself.

As well as having a relaxing and secure feeling throughout the story, something which we were able to maintain by choosing the right theme of music, and in the visuals by involving animals, teddy bears and characters from the story.

## Key Components
In this Project, which is a continuum of the original '[VR Story Time](https://github.com/husen1015/vrStoryTime)' in semester A, contains many more elements and a more immersive experience, the key additions are

* **AI Components** - the Story itself, which we called '**Melody and the Flute of Harmoneyville**' was produced using ChatGPT, along with the narration and sound of characters in the experience, were produced using AI as well.
* **Better Assets** - choosing the assets and the theme of the project is a challenge by itself, we made sure to choose consistent assets that contribute to the overall feeling that we want the user to experience - calmness and safe.
* **Stability** - Everything that we learned in the first project, we fixed and applied in this one, as well as many more additions and modifications of the code to ensure versatile development and encapsulation in its components.
